    Write a function that creates a BeautifulSoup object after retrieving content from
    "https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=fantasy&qid=NwUsLiA2Nc". Parse through the object and return a list of
    URLs for each of the first ten books in the search using the following format:

    Notice that you should ONLY add URLs that start with "/book/show/" to 
    your list, and be sure to append the full path (https://www.goodreads.com) to the URL so that the url is in the format 
    “https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/kdkd".

    Write a function that creates a BeautifulSoup object that extracts book
    information from a book's webpage, given the HTML file of the book. Parse through
    the BeautifulSoup object, and capture the book title, book author, number of pages, 
    and book rating. This function should return a tuple in the following format:
    
    ('Some book title', 'the book's author', number of pages, book rating)
    
    HINT: Using BeautifulSoup's find() method may help you here.
    You can easily capture CSS selectors with your browser's inspector window.
    Make sure to strip() any newlines from the book title, number of pages, and rating.

    BOOKS OF 2021" page in "best_books_2021.html". This function should create a 
    BeautifulSoup object from a filepath and return a list of (category, book title, 
    URL) tuples.
    
    For example, if the best book in category "Fiction" is "The Testaments (The 
    Handmaid's Tale, #2)", with URL
    https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-fiction-books-2020, then you should

    Write a function that takes in a list of tuples (called data, i.e. the
   one that is returned by get_titles_from_search_results()), sorts the tuples in 
   descending order by largest rating, writes the data to a csv file, and saves it to 
   the passed filename.
   The first row of the csv should contain "Book title", "Author Name", “Rating”, 
   respectively as column headers. For each tuple in data, write a new
   row to the csv, placing each element of the tuple in the correct column.
 
   When you are done your CSV file should look like this:
 
   Book title,Author Name,Rating
   Book1,Author1,Rating1
   Book2,Author2,Rating2
   Book3,Author3,Rating3
   
   In order of highest rating to lowest rating.
